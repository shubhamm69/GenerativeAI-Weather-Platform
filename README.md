## Introduction

The Generative AI Weather Platform is designed to provide real-time weather data by leveraging the power of Generative AI and IoT technology. By integrating an Arduino board with a DHT sensor, this platform can accurately sense and collect humidity and temperature data from the environment.

## Features

- Real-time weather data collection using Arduino and DHT sensor
- Generative AI algorithms for weather prediction and analysis
- User-friendly web interface for data visualization
- Customizable alerts and notifications based on weather conditions

## Installation

To install and set up the Generative AI Weather Platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/shubhamm69/GenerativeAI-Weather-Platform.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Connect the Arduino board with the DHT sensor to your computer
4. Configure the Arduino board and sensor settings in the `config.js` file
5. Start the platform: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the platform is up and running, you can access the web interface to view real-time weather data, predictions, and analysis. You can also customize alerts and notifications based on specific weather conditions.
